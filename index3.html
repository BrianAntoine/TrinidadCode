					<h3>"I have a vision for Trinidads Future" - Brian Antoine</h3>
                    <p>During the summer of 2018, I enrolled in a coding boot camp that taught Python, Java, Java Script, HTML, cloud Authentication and CSS. At the end of that program, I created a mobile application with two other peers, that alerted people within a neighborhood about a recent crime that may have been committed in their community. Also, I have participated in numerous hackathons, such as PennApps and TreeHacks, which I was able to learn Swift from a couple of lectures that were held at the event. On the side I have used my HTML, CSS and Java skills by having a website development and App prototyping business that I use to gain more personal experiences and money on the side. One website I created was for Newark Public Schools System in Newark, New Jersey for their Covid and Healthy Classrooms project that needed a website and post test system.  </p>
